# Chaotic MTD-Based Meta-Learning Multi-Label IDS

This project implements a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy using chaos theory, combined with a multi-label IDS for detecting blended attacks in SDN environments. The defense incorporates reinforcement learning for adaptive strategy selection.
Features
- Integrated with Ryu SDN controller
- Supports CIC-IDS2017/2018/2019 and CIRA-CIC-DoBre2020 datasets
- Dynamic IP/Port/Path mutation strategies
